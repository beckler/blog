Hello there, I'm Michael.<br/>
I'm a developer, [musician](https://soundcloud.com/mcbeckler), father, maker, and native to the Atlanta area.

I'm currently a Senior Security Software Engineer at [GE Power](https://www.ge.com/power).

## What's the point of this site?

Day-to-day, I deal with a pretty wide variety of issues, and I start side projects all the time, although I usually never complete them.

So this website is mostly for documenting some of the various challenges I've dealt with along the way.

## Anything else?

Sure.
