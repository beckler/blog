Howdy! Welcome!

I'm a developer in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and I've been in the industry professionally since 2011. I enjoy tinkering with electronics, building stuff, reverse engineering, making music, and the great outdoors. 

I'm honestly pretty boring overall, so I'll be surprised if anyone gets any use out of this.
