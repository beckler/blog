# Finding your voice is hard

True story: I've attempted to start this blog several times.

The problem is that I feel like I can only contribute very little the gigantic number of voices out there already. What value could I bring that thousands of others haven't already provided? 

The answer is probably very little, but if I never start I'll never know. So this short post is me taking a moment to thank you, dear reader, for finding you way here somehow. I hope you find something here that brings you joy.
